                        with US CMA is a Value Added Course with US CMA (Certified Management
                        Accountant). CMA is a professional certification in finance &amp;
                        accounting relevant for success in businesses. Achieving the
                        CMA&nbsp;demonstrates professional expertise in financial planning,
                        analysis, control, decision support, and professional ethics –
                        skills that are in demand by organizations around the world.
                        Basically, CMAs can explain the “why” behind numbers, not just
                        the “what”. The CMA degree gives greater credibility, higher
                        earning potential, and ultimately a seat at the leadership table.

                        professional qualifications mandate a institute degree, and given the
                        fact that NSU education covers a vast majority of the content, the

                        the profession. Therefore, US professional qualifications like CMA
                        “complement” university education and have lesser number of
